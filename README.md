This is a my exhibition of experimentation in Technical Space and a place to share my learnings. My objectives: Growth, Learning &amp; Outcomes  

# 👋 Hey, I'm Sukhmaan Rathore  
🎯 Technical Program Manager | Software Engineer | Artist & Producer  

Welcome to my portfolio. I’m passionate about building **large-scale distributed systems**, **secure integrations**, and **creative tech experiences** that connect logic with emotion.  

I combine engineering depth with program management strategy — turning complex system designs into reliable, scalable, and meaningful outcomes.
